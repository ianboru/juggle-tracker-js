Juggling Flow Arts

Juggling Flow Arts was created by Stephen Meschke and Ian Borukhovich in 2019. Juggling Flow Arts is augmented reality software. Objects are detected with computer vision. Tracked objects are animated. The objects can be connected, marked with trails, or dotted with confetti.

How it works:

Color segmentation is used for tracking. First the user arranges the camera and background so that the tracked object has a unique color. For example, the user could track a bright green tennis ball. The user then removes everything that is bright green from the background of the frame. After that, the user selects a narrow range of color that describes the color of the tennis ball. The computer can then track the tennis ball by looking for something in the that color range.

How to use: 

Lighting Suggestions: Find an object that is bright. Point the lights at the object, and make sure that no lights point directly into the camera.

Click on the color that matches your object. This will tell the computer which color to track. Use the sliders to find the perfect color range. 

If you want more than one color, hit ‘add color’ and repeat the process.
